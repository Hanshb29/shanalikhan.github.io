title: Linked In Rest API with OAuth 2 Concept
description : OAuth concept to connect your application to LinkedIn Api  , facebook and twitter. 
---

In this post im going to tell you step by step in order to integrate the OAuth with LinkedIn Api. 
Connecting with other OAuth providers will be similar.



In this example i will use shanalikhan1.github.io as redirect url and XXX to denate keys these would be the place holders where you will insert your url and keys.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>
<a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">
Register Your Application
</a>
</strong>
<br/>
You need to set the scope of your application after registering by scope means to authorize your application in order to use Linked API. For advance API levels you might need to contact with Linked In order to get permission.
Once you save your configuration, your application will be assigned a unique "Client ID" (otherwise known as Consumer Key or API key) and "Client Secret" value.

</li>

<li>
<strong>
Get An Authorization Code
</strong>
<br/>
Sample Call :
<br/>
https://www.linkedin.com/uas/oauth2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_APP_CODE&redirect_uri=YOUR_WEBSITE_ENCODED_URL&state=987654321
<br/>
<div class="resource-table-section header-row">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Parameter</td><td>Description</td><td>Required</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>response_type</td><td>The value of this field should always
be:&nbsp; code</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>client_id</td><td>The "API Key" value generated when
you registered your application.</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>redirect_uri</td><td><p>The URI your users will be sent back
to after authorization.&nbsp; This value must match one of the
defined OAuth 2.0 Redirect URLs in your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer" rel="nofollow">application configuration</a>.<br></p>
<p>
<br> e.g. https://www.example.com/auth/linkedin</p></td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>state</td><td><p>A unique string value of your choice that is
hard to guess. Used to prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CSRF</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br> e.g. state=DCEeFWf45A53sdfKef424</p></td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>scope</td><td><p>A URL-encoded, space delimited list of member
permissions your application is requesting on behalf of the
user.&nbsp; If you do not specify a scope in your call, we will
fall back to using the default member permissions you defined
in your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer" rel="nofollow">application configuration</a>.</p>
<p>
<br> e.g. scope=r_fullprofile%20r_emailaddress%20w_share</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td><td>Optional</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</li>

<li><strong>When Application Is Approved</strong>
<br/>
When the application is approved LinkedIN will redirect to your URL with some information with 2 query string parameters.
    > code — The OAuth 2.0 authorization code.
    > state — A value used to test for possible CSRF attacks.
    > error_description - If error is found ( if user pass authorization successfully it doesnt appear in URL )
  
  
</li>

</ul>
