description : Edit the Setting JSON file manually for Visual Studio Code Settings Sync.
---

If the extension is not setup then dont edit this file and read the Read mE [here](http://shanalikhan.github.io/2015/12/15/Visual-Studio-Code-Sync-Settings.html)


Now you can easily edit the Settings here if you have all the things.

Settings is in complete JSON format so please make sure you dont break the JSON rules. When you make a edit, make sure you
have a backup JSON file to replace with in case of extension not working.

JSON has two parts the **Token** and **GIST** which you need to add correctly to run extension.

**Don't Change the other fields like Dates or it will stop working...**
