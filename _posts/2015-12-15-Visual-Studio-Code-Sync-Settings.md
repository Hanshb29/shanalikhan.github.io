I have developed a small utility in order to synchronize your visual studio code settings across multiple machines. Whether your editor settings are changed in office you can set synchronize that settings in home editor also.

## Key Features
	* Use your github account token.
	* Easy to Upload and Download on one click.
	
### Steps To Get the Github Key.

This extension required your GitHub Account Personal Access Token. You can create one simple by looking into the following pictures.

<strong>Goto Settings / Personal Access Tokens / Generate New Token</strong>

<strong>Select Scopes</strong>

<strong>Get Unique Key</strong>

You need to save this key for this extension, and dont share this key with anyone as it will get your data without needing to logg in.
