They wont be able to change your settings or extenion information so you can share your settings with your friends and teams. Following are the simple steps to do so: 


### Creating GIST To Share

By default extension creates the secret GIST so only you can see it from your github page. So you need to create the public GIST so anyone can see your GIST contents.

> By command : Sync : Advance Options > Share Settings with Public GIST

It will remove your current Gist and create new public Gist and upload the settings. You can share your settings with other users.


### Downloading The Settings From Shared GIST

> By command : Sync : Download Settings

Just enter the public Gist, it will automatically download the Gist contents. 

Extension dont allow users to edit or change the Gist of other Users.
