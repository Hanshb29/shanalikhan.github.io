title: Visual Studio Sync Settings Migration 
description : Migration to new version for extension Visual Studio Code Sync Settings supporting multiple file formats in snippets folder
---

Migration to new version is important.

Initially, The extension was designed in such a way that Although the files added in snippets folder are only JSON files. But from this version of the update. You can make backup to any of the file type either its simple TXT or JSON file online in GITHUB GIST.



To allow file extensions other then JSON,  previous order of GitHub GIST needed to replace so you need to backup to new gist in order to use this version.

If you found any problem. Feel free to open any [issue](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync/issues)
